# My playground for .NET ideas
* We will look into design patterns using C# and .NET Core

## SOLID princples
### Single Responsibility
* A class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality
### Open/Closed
* A class should be open to extension but closed to modification
### Liskov Substitution
* A subclass should be able to be used in place of its parent class - Using inheritance to your advantage
### Interface Segregation
* A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement - Interfaces splitting
### Dependency Inversion
* Your classes and modules should depend on decoupled abstractions instead of complete implementations
